## Day 8 – 2-bit and 4-bit Magnitude Comparators

On Day 8 of my Verilog 50-Day Challenge, I implemented **2-bit and 4-bit magnitude comparators** using dataflow modeling.

### 🧠 What is a Magnitude Comparator?
A comparator checks whether:
- `a > b`
- `a == b`
- `a < b`

### 🧮 What I implemented:
- **2-bit comparator:** Compares 2-bit inputs
- **4-bit comparator:** Compares 4-bit inputs
- All modeled using simple relational operators

### 🧪 Tested on Vivado:
Multiple cases tested including edge values. Outputs verified through waveform simulation.

These modules are foundational blocks in processors and decision-making circuits in digital systems.
