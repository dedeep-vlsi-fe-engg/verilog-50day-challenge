# Day 20 – SR and JK Flip-Flops

📅 50-Day Verilog HDL Challenge  
📁 Folder: Day-20_FlipFlops  
🛠️ Tool: Xilinx Vivado  
✍️ Modeling Style: Behavioral (Edge-triggered)

## ✅ SR Flip-Flop

- Triggered on rising edge of clock
- Set, Reset, Hold, and Invalid state
- Used in simple sequential storage

## ✅ JK Flip-Flop

- Enhancement of SR Flip-Flop
- No invalid state
- Toggle functionality (J=1, K=1)
- Widely used in counters and FSMs
