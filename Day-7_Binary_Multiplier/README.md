## Day 7 – 4-bit Binary Multiplier

On Day 7 of my Verilog 50-Day Challenge, I implemented a **4-bit Binary Multiplier** using **dataflow modeling**.

### ✨ What it does:
Multiplies two 4-bit binary numbers (`a` and `b`) and produces an 8-bit result (`product`).

### 🔧 Module Features:
- Inputs: 4-bit operands `a` and `b`
- Output: 8-bit `product`
- Technique: Uses the `*` operator for multiplication

### 🔍 Why important?
Multipliers are fundamental blocks in ALUs, DSPs, signal/image processors, and hardware accelerators.

### ✅ Tested in Vivado:
- Various inputs verified
- Waveforms observed and confirmed correct functionality

A solid step towards understanding arithmetic logic units (ALUs) in digital systems!
