# Day 39 – Traffic Light Controller

📅 Verilog 50-Day HDL Challenge  
📂 Folder: Day-39_Traffic_Light_Controller

---

## 🚦 Project Description

Designed a 3-state FSM to control a single-direction traffic light signal using Verilog.

### ⏲️ State Flow:
- 🔴 RED → 🟢 GREEN → 🟡 YELLOW → 🔴 RED ...

### 🎯 Features:
- Clean FSM logic with three well-defined states
- Each state activates one light at a time
- Simulated successfully in Xilinx Vivado

### 💡 FSM States:
- `RED`: Only red light is on
- `GREEN`: Only green light is on
- `YELLOW`: Only yellow light is on

---

## 🧪 Test Pattern:
Clock cycles simulate signal changes in traffic lights every 10ns.
