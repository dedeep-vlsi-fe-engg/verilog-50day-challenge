# 🔰 Verilog 50-Day Challenge – Day 1: Logic Gates

Welcome to Day 1 of my Verilog 50-Day Challenge focused on becoming a VLSI Front-End Engineer. Today’s task was to implement all basic logic gates using **dataflow modeling** in Verilog and simulate them using **Vivado**.

### 🔧 Gates Implemented:
- AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR

### 📁 Files Included:
- `gates_df.v`: Verilog code using dataflow modeling  
- `gates_df_tb.v`: Testbench for all gates  
- `gate_waveform.png`: Output simulation waveform  
- `gate_RTL Schematic.png`: RTL schematic from Vivado  
- `README.md`: This documentation file

### 🛠 Tools Used:  
- Xilinx Vivado  
- VS Code  
- Git & GitHub

This challenge helps strengthen my foundation in digital logic design and prepares me for more advanced topics in RTL development. Next up is **Day 2: Half Adder and Full Adder using dataflow modeling**. Follow along for daily updates and practical Verilog projects!
