# Day 38 â€“ Sequence Detector (Detects "1010")

ğŸ“… Verilog 50-Day HDL Challenge  
ğŸ“‚ Folder: Day-38_Sequence_Detector

---

## ğŸ§  Description

This is a **4-state Moore FSM** that detects the sequence "1010" in a serial input stream.  
- Input: Serial bit stream (`in`)
- Output: `detected = 1` when "1010" is found.
- Overlapping sequences are supported.

---

## ğŸ’¡ State Flow:
- S0 â†’ S1 on `1`
- S1 â†’ S2 on `0`
- S2 â†’ S3 on `1`
- S3 â†’ S4 on `0` â†’ `detected = 1`

---

## ğŸ§ª Test Pattern:
Input: `110101010`  
Output: `detected = 1` at bit positions matching `1010`.
