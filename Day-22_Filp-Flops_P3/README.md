# Day 22 – Master-Slave JK Flip-Flop

📅 50-Day Verilog HDL Challenge  
📁 Folder: Day-22_MasterSlave_JK_FF  
🛠️ Tool: Xilinx Vivado  
✍️ Modeling Style: Behavioral (Master-Slave Edge Triggered)

---

## ✅ Description

This design implements a **Master-Slave JK Flip-Flop**, a crucial building block in sequential digital circuits.  
It eliminates the invalid state of SR FF and adds toggling functionality — ideal for designing counters and memory elements.

- **Master:** Triggers on falling edge of clock (negedge)
- **Slave:** Triggers on rising edge of clock (posedge)

## 🧪 Testbench

A full simulation using Vivado verifies the flip-flop with all possible input combinations of J and K.
