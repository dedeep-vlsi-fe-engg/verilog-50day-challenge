# Day 33 – 4-bit Synchronous Up/Down Counter

📅 50-Day Verilog HDL Challenge  
📁 Folder: Day-33_Synchronous_UpDown_Counter  
🛠️ Tool: Xilinx Vivado  
✍️ Modeling Style: Behavioral

## ✅ Description

This project implements a **4-bit synchronous counter** with directional control.

- `up_down = 1` → Counts up
- `up_down = 0` → Counts down
- `rst = 1` → Resets to 0000

All bits toggle **synchronously** on the **positive clock edge**.

## 🧪 Simulation

- Clock: 10ns period
- Starts with reset
- Simulates both up and down counting
- Waveform confirms correct and stable transitions
