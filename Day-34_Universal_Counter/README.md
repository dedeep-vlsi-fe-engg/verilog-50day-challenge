🛠️ Tool: Xilinx Vivado  
✍️ Modeling Style: Behavioral

## ✅ Description

This project implements a **Universal 4-bit Synchronous Counter** with all major features:

- **Enable (`en`)** – turns counting ON/OFF
- **Up/Down (`up_down`)** – toggles between incrementing and decrementing
- **Load (`load`)** – synchronous load of external 4-bit value
- **Clear (`clr`)** – asynchronous reset to zero

The counter is fully controlled by logic signals and can be used in **state machines**, **digital controllers**, and **multimode counters**.

## 🧪 Simulation

Simulation includes:
- Reset
- Loading a value
- Up and down counting
- Disabling counter
- Clearing output asynchronously

Waveform shows full-featured, robust counter behavior.
