## ğŸ•’ Project Description

This project simulates a binary digital clock that counts in **Minutes:Seconds (MM:SS)** format using 6-bit mod-60 counters.

---

## ğŸ”§ Features:
- Counts up to 59 seconds, then resets and increments the minute count
- Minutes also count up to 59, then reset
- Simulated at a faster clock (10ns) for demonstration purposes
- Designed and simulated using Xilinx Vivado

---

## ğŸ§ª Testbench:
Simulates ~1 minute in accelerated time to test both `seconds` and `minutes` rollovers.
