# Day 37 – Dual Mode Counter (Sync/Async)

📅 Verilog 50-Day HDL Challenge  
🎯 Project: Configurable 4-bit counter with mode select  
📂 Folder: Day-37_Dual_Mode_Counter

---

## 🔧 Description

This counter can operate in:
- **Asynchronous (Ripple) mode**: Flip-flops triggered sequentially.
- **Synchronous mode**: Flip-flops triggered by the same clock.

### 🎮 Control:
- `mode = 0`: Ripple (asynchronous) counter
- `mode = 1`: Synchronous counter

✅ Ideal for understanding hardware design trade-offs between sync and async logic.
