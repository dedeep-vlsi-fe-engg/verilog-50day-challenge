## ✅ Description

This module implements a **Serial-In Serial-Out (SISO) shift register**, which allows single-bit serial input to propagate through a 4-bit register and appear as output bit-by-bit.

🟢 Used in:
- Serial bitstream processing
- UART/SPI communication
- Data delay/pipelining

---

## 🧪 Simulation

Testbench verifies the register correctly shifts bits on every clock cycle.  
Final output is the **most significant bit (MSB)** of the shift register.
